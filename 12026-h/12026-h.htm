<h2>PRESS NOTICES</h2>

<p>Mr. Freeman's landscapes have an individuality which entitles him to his
own place as a poet of nature.... The appreciation of his lofty ardours,
his desolate landscapes and his strange, though beautiful, rhythms and
forms of verse, is not one which springs up instantly in the mind; but
once it has arisen it does not diminish.&mdash;<i>New Statesman</i>.</p>

<p>I think that whatever limitations our age and our poetry may have, Mr.
Freeman's poetry, and much else that is now being written, will find in
all succeeding generations readers to whom it will give companionship
and comfort.&mdash;Mr. J.C. Squire, in <i>Land and Water</i>.</p>

<p>This book must be read steadily through; quotation can reveal little of
its scope, its richness.... When a man, in poems that are clearly
fragments of autobiography, thus surrenders to the world the life of his
spirit, the beauty of what he writes is inseparable from its truth.
Truth endures, and a prophet would have a sad foreboding of posterity if
he did not believe that of this day's poets Mr. Freeman will not be
among the forgotten.&mdash;<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>.</p>

<p>This rarefied air is something to which the reader must adjust himself;
but he finds the process of adjustment made easy by a peculiar
fascination in the atmosphere which Mr. Freeman creates. If it is aloof
from ordinary experience, it is by so much the more individual; and in
it there are to be found thrills and feelings, an understanding of a
particular aspect of nature, which have not hitherto been reported in
poetry&mdash;<i>Westminster Gazette</i>.</p>

<h2>NOTE.</h2>

<p>With the exception of two or three poems which have appeared in
newspapers, or in an anthology entitled <i>Twelve Poets</i>, the verses in
the first part of this volume have not hitherto been printed. The second
part contains <i>Memories of Childhood and Other Poems</i>, and the third
part retrieves many verses from <i>Presage of Victory</i> (1916), <i>Stone
Trees</i> (1916), <i>Fifty Poems</i> (1911) and <i>Twenty Poems</i> (1909).
Chronological order has not been carefully observed, or avoided, in the
arrangement of the third part, but the earlier pieces will easily be
distinguished by those who may wish to distinguish them.</p>

<span>Hear me, O beeches! You<br /></span>
<span>That have with ageless anguish slowly risen<br /></span>
<span>From earth's still secret prison<br /></span>
<span>Into the ampler prison of aery blue.<br /></span>
<span>Your voice I hear, flowing the valleys through<br /></span>
<span>After the wind that tramples from the west.<br /></span>
<span>After the wind your boughs in new unrest<br /></span>
<span>Shake, and your voice&mdash;one voice uniting voices<br /></span>
<span>A thousand or a thousand thousand&mdash;flows<br /></span>
<span>Like the wind's moody; glad when he rejoices<br /></span>
<span>In swift-succeeding and diminishing blows,<br /></span>
<span>And drooping when declines death's ardour in his breast;<br /></span>
<span>Then over him exhausted weaving the soft fan-like noises<br /></span>

<span>That high and noble wind is rootless nor<br /></span>
<span>From stable earth sucks nurture, but roams on<br /></span>
<span>Childless as fatherless, wild, unconfined,<br /></span>
<span>So that men say, &quot;As homeless as the wind!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Rising and falling and rising evermore<br /></span>
<span>With years like ticks, &aelig;ons as centuries gone;<br /></span>
<span>Only within impalpable ether bound<br /></span>
<span>And blindly with the green globe spinning round.<br /></span>
<span>He, noble wind,<br /></span>
<span>Most ancient creature of imprisoned Time,<br /></span>
<span>From high to low may fall, and low to high may climb,<br /></span>
<span>Andean peak to deep-caved southern sea,<br /></span>
<span>With lifted hand and voice of gathered sound,<br /></span>
<span>And echoes in his tossing quiver bound<br /></span>
<span>And loosed from height into immensity;<br /></span>
<span>Yet of his freedom tires, remaining free.<br /></span>
<span>&mdash;Moulding and remoulding imponderable cloud,<br /></span>
<span>Uplifting skiey archipelagian isles<br /></span>
<span>Sunnier than ocean's, blue seas and white isles<br /></span>

<span>Earth, sun, air, water, and the chemic fruit<br /></span>
<span>Wise Time of these has made. What laughing Springs<br /></span>
<span>Your branches sprinkle young leaf-shadows o'er<br /></span>
<span>That wanting the leaf-shadows were no Springs<br /></span>
<span>Of seasonable sweet and freshness! nor<br /></span>

<span>Increase of music as your leaves grow dense,<br /></span>
<span>Might even kine and birds and general noise of wings<br /></span>
<span>Of summer make full Summer, but the hot<br /></span>
<span>Slow moons would pass and leave unsatisfied the sense.<br /></span>
<span>Nor Autumn's waste were dear if your gold snow<br /></span>
<span>Of leaves whirled not upon the gold below;<br /></span>
<span>Nor Winter's snow were loveliness complete<br /></span>
<span>Wanting the white drifts round your breasts and feet.<br /></span>

<span>Likeness of an inverted cloudy heaven;<br /></span>
<span>How many English hills enlarge their pride<br /></span>
<span>Of shape and solitude<br /></span>
<span>By beechwoods darkening the steepest side!<br /></span>
<span>I know a Mount&mdash;let there my longing brood<br /></span>
<span>Again, as oft my eyes&mdash;a Mount I know<br /></span>
<span>Where beeches stand arrested in the throe<br /></span>
<span>Of that last onslaught when the gods swept low<br /></span>
<span>Against the gods inhabiting the wood.<br /></span>
<span>Gods into trees did pass and disappear,<br /></span>
<span>Then closing, body and huge members heaved<br /></span>
<span>With energy and agony and fear.<br /></span>
<span>See how the thighs were strained, how tortured here.<br /></span>
<span>See, limb from limb sprung, pain too sore to bear.<br /></span>
<span>Eyes once looked from those sockets that no eyes<br /></span>
<span>Have worn since&mdash;oh, with what desperate surprise!<br /></span>
<span>These arms, uplifted still, were raised in vain<br /></span>
<span>Against alien triumph and the inward pain.<br /></span>
<span>Unlock your arms, and be no more distressed,<br /></span>
<span>Let the wind glide over you easily again.<br /></span>
<span>It is a dream you fight, a memory<br /></span>
<span>Of battle lost. And how should dreaming be<br /></span>

<span>New-winged with Autumn from the distant sea<br /></span>
<span>And springs upon you, how should not dreaming be<br /></span>
<span>A remembered and renewing agony?<br /></span>
<span>Then are your breasts, O unleaved beeches, again<br /></span>
<span>Torn, and your thighs and arms with the old strain<br /></span>
<span>Stretched past endurance; and your groans I hear<br /></span>
<span>Low bent beneath the hoofs by that fierce charioteer<br /></span>
<span>Driven clashing over; till even dreaming is<br /></span>
<span>Less of a present agony than this.<br /></span>

<span>Sentinel'd by shades slow-marching with moss-footed hours that creep<br /></span>
<span>From dusk of night to dusk of day&mdash;slow-marching, yet too soon<br /></span>
<span>Approaching morn? Are these their grave<br /></span>

<span>And the thin failing hosts<br /></span>
<span>Into your secrecies are swift withdrawn<br /></span>
<span>Before the certain footsteps of the dawn.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>But you, O beeches, even as men have root<br /></span>

<span>From the unfathomed fountains of your gloom.<br /></span>
<span>Late western sunbeams on your broad trunks bloom,<br /></span>
<span>Levelled from the low opposing hill, and fold<br /></span>

<span>Paint their vivid mark,<br /></span>
<span>Ciphering fatality on each unwrinkled bark<br /></span>
<span>Across the sunken stain<br /></span>
<span>That every season's gathered streaming rain<br /></span>

<span>The sundered trunk upon the enormous wain<br /></span>
<span>Bound kinglike with chain over chain,<br /></span>

<span>And that obscure sign's read, or swift misread,<br /></span>
<span>By the indifferent woodman or his slave<br /></span>
<span>Disease, night-wandered from a fever-dripping cave.<br /></span>
<span>No chain's then needed for no fearful king,<br /></span>

<span>Of faintly-glinting dusking monochrome;<br /></span>
<span>And stars thick hung as leaves shake unseen in the round<br /></span>
<span>Of darkening blue: the heavenly branches wave without a sound,<br /></span>
<span>Only betrayed by fine vibration of thin air.<br /></span>
<span>Gleam now the nearer stars and ghosts of farther stars that bare,<br /></span>
<span>Trembling and gradual, brightness everywhere....<br /></span>
<span>When leaves fall wildly and your beechen dome is thinned,<br /></span>
<span>Showered glittering down under the sudden wind;<br /></span>
<span>And when you, crowded stars, are shaken from your tree<br /></span>
<span>In time's late season stripped, and each bough nakedly<br /></span>
<span>Rocks in those gleamless shallows of infinity;<br /></span>
<span>When star-fall follows leaf-fall, will long Winter pass away<br /></span>
<span>And new stars as new leaves dance through their hasty May?<br /></span>
<span>&mdash;But as a leaf falls so falls weightless thought<br /></span>
<span>Eddying, and with a myriad dead leaves lies<br /></span>
<span>Bewildered, or in a little air awhile is caught<br /></span>
<span>Idly, then drops and dies.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Look at the stars, the stars! But in this wood<br /></span>
<span>All I can understand is understood.<br /></span>
<span>Gentler than stars your beeches speak; I hear<br /></span>
<span>Syllables more simple and intimately clear<br /></span>
<span>To earth-taught sense, than the heaven-singing word<br /></span>
<span>Of that intemperate wisdom which the sky<br /></span>
<span>Shakes down upon each unregarding century,<br /></span>
<span>There lying like snow unstirred,<br /></span>
<span>Unmelting, on the loftiest peak<br /></span>
<span>Above our human and green valley ways.<br /></span>
<span>Lowlier and friendlier your beechen branches speak<br /></span>
<span>To men of mortal days<br /></span>
<span>With hearts too fond, too weak<br /></span>
<span>For solitude or converse with that starry race.<br /></span>
<span>Their shaken lights,<br /></span>
<span>Their lonely splendours and uncomprehended<br /></span>
<span>Dream-distance and long circlings 'mid the heights<br /></span>
<span>And deeps remotely neighboured and attended<br /></span>
<span>By spheres that spill their fire through these estranging nights:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Ah, were they less dismaying, or less splendid!<br /></span>
<span>But as one deaf and mute sees the lips shape<br /></span>
<span>And quiver as men talk, or marks the throat<br /></span>
<span>Of rising song that he can never hear,<br /></span>
<span>Though in the singer's eyes her joy may dimly peer,<br /></span>
<span>And song and word his hopeless sense escape&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Sweet common word and lifted heavenly note&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>So, beneath that bright rain,<br /></span>
<span>While stars rise, soar and stoop,<br /></span>
<span>Dazzled and dismayed I look and droop<br /></span>
<span>And, blinded, look again.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&quot;Return, return!&quot; O beeches sing you then.<br /></span>
<span>I like a tree wave all my thoughts with you,<br /></span>
<span>As your boughs wave to other tossed boughs when<br /></span>
<span>First in the windy east the dawn looks through<br /></span>
<span>Night's soon-dissolving bars.<br /></span>
<span>Return, return? But I have never strayed:<br /></span>
<span>Hush, thoughts, that for a moment played<br /></span>
<span>In that enchanted forest of the stars<br /></span>
<span>Where the mind grows numb.<br /></span>
<span>Return, return?<br /></span>
<span>Back, thoughts, from heights that freeze and deeps that burn,<br /></span>
<span>Where sight fails and song's dumb.<br /></span>
<span>And as, after long absence, a child stands<br /></span>
<span>In each familiar room<br /></span>
<span>And with fond hands<br /></span>
<span>Touches the table, casement, bed,<br /></span>
<span>Anon each sleeping, half-forgotten toy;<br /></span>
<span>So I to your sharp light and friendly gloom<br /></span>
<span>Returning, with first pale leaves round me shed,<br /></span>
<span>Recover the old joy<br /></span>
<span>Since here the long-acquainted hill-path lies,<br /></span>
<span>Steeps I have clambered up, and spaces where<br /></span>
<span>The Mount opens her bosom to the air<br /></span>
<span>And all around gigantic beeches rise.<br /></span>

<span>I reached the cottage. I knew it from the card<br /></span>
<span>He had given me&mdash;the low door heavily barred,<br /></span>
<span>Steep roof, and two yews whispering on guard.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Dusk thickened as I came, but I could smell<br /></span>
<span>First red wallflower and an early hyacinth bell,<br /></span>
<span>And see dim primroses. &quot;O, I can tell,&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>I thought, &quot;they love the flowers he loved.&quot; The rain<br /></span>
<span>Shook from fruit bushes in new showers again<br /></span>
<span>As I brushed past, and gemmed the window pane.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Bare was the window yet, and the lamp bright.<br /></span>
<span>I saw them sitting there, streamed with the light<br /></span>
<span>That overflowed upon the enclosing night.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&quot;Poor things, I wonder why they've lit up so,&quot;<br /></span>
<span>A voice said, passing on the road below.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Who are they?&quot; asked another. &quot;Don't you know?&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Their voices crept away. I heard no more<br /></span>
<span>As I crossed the garden and knocked at the door.<br /></span>
<span>I waited, then knocked louder than before,<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And thrice, and still in vain. So on the grass<br /></span>
<span>I stepped, and tap-tapped on the rainy glass.<br /></span>
<span>Then did a girl without turning towards me pass<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>From the room. I heard the heavy barred door creak,<br /></span>
<span>And a voice entreating from the doorway speak,<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Will you come this way?&quot;&mdash;a voice childlike and quick.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>The way was dark. I followed her white frock,<br /></span>
<span>Past the now-chiming, sweet-tongued unseen clock,<br /></span>
<span>Into the room. One figure like a rock<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Draped in an unstarred night&mdash;his mother&mdash;bowed<br /></span>
<span>Unrising and unspeaking. His aunt stood<br /></span>
<span>And took my hand, murmuring, &quot;So good, so good!&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Never such quiet people had I known.<br /></span>
<span>Voices they scarcely needed, they had grown<br /></span>
<span>To talk less by the word than muted tone.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&quot;We'll soon have tea,&quot; the girl said. &quot;Please sit here.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>She pushed a heavy low deep-seated chair<br /></span>
<span>I knew at once was his; and I sat there.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>I could not look at them. It seemed I made<br /></span>
<span>Noise in that quietness. I was afraid<br /></span>
<span>To look or speak until the aunt's voice said,<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&quot;You were his friend.&quot; And that &quot;You were!&quot; awoke<br /></span>
<span>My sense, and nervousness found voice and spoke<br /></span>
<span>Of what he had been, until a bullet broke<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>A too-brief friendship. The rock-like mother kept<br /></span>
<span>Night still around her. The aunt silently wept,<br /></span>
<span>And the girl into the screen's low shadow stept.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&quot;You were great friends,&quot; said with calm voice the mother.<br /></span>
<span>I answered, &quot;Never friend had such another.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Then the girl's lips, &quot;Nor sister such a brother.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Her words were like a sounding pebble cast<br /></span>
<span>Into a hollow silence; but at last<br /></span>
<span>She moved and bending to my low chair passed<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Swift leaf-like fingers o'er my face and said,<br /></span>
<span>&quot;You are not like him.&quot; And as she turned her head<br /></span>
<span>Into full light beneath the lamp's green shade<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>I saw the sunken spaces of her eyes.<br /></span>
<span>Then her face listening to my dumb surprise.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Forgive,&quot; she said, &quot;a blind girl's liberties.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&quot;You were his friend; I wanted so to see<br /></span>
<span>The friends my brother had. Now let's have tea.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>She poured, and passed a cup and cakes to me.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&quot;These are my cakes,&quot; she smiled; and as I ate<br /></span>
<span>She talked, and to the others cup and plate<br /></span>
<span>Passed as they in their shadow and silence sat.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&quot;Thanks, we are used to each other,&quot; she said when I<br /></span>
<span>Rose in the awkwardness of seeing, shy<br /></span>
<span>Of helping and of watching helplessly.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And from the manner of their hands 'twas clear<br /></span>
<span>They too were blind; but I knew they could hear<br /></span>
<span>My pitiful thoughts as I sat aching there.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>... I needs must talk, until the girl was gone<br /></span>
<span>A while out of the room. The lamp shone on,<br /></span>
<span>But the true light out of the room was gone.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&quot;Rose loved him so!&quot; her mother said, and sighed.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;He was our eyes, he was our joy and pride,<br /></span>
<span>And all that's left is but to say he died.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>She ceased as Rose returned. Then as before<br /></span>
<span>We talked and paused until, &quot;Tell me once more,<br /></span>
<span>What was it he said?&quot; And I told her once more.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>She listened: in her face was pride and pain<br /></span>
<span>As in her mind's eye near he stood and plain....<br /></span>
<span>Then the thin leaves fell on my cheek again<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And on my hands. &quot;He must have loved you well,&quot;<br /></span>
<span>She whispered, as her hands from my hands fell.<br /></span>
<span>Silence flowed back with thoughts unspeakable.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>It was a painful thing to leave them there<br /></span>
<span>Within the useless light and stirless air.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Let me show you the way. Mind, there's a stair<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&quot;Here, then another stair ten paces on....<br /></span>
<span>Isn't there a moon? Good-bye.&quot;<br /></span>
<span class='i11'>And she was gone.<br /></span>
<span>Full moon upon the drenched fruit garden shone.<br /></span>

<span>Lightly men say, 'Even the gods come and go!'&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>He paused awhile in pacing and hung still,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Amid the thickening shades a darker shade.<br /></span>
<span>Down the steep valley from the barren hill<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>A herd of deer with antlered leader made<br /></span>
<span>Brief apparition. Mist brimmed up until<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Only the great round heights yet solid stayed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Then they too changed to spectral, and upon<br /></span>
<span>The changing mist wavered, and were gone....<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&quot;Standing to-day your father's grave beside,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>I knew my heart with his was covered there;<br /></span>
<span>O, more than flesh did in the cold earth hide&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>My past, his promise. There was none to care<br /></span>
<span>Save for the body of a prince that died<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>As princes die; there was none whispered, 'Where<br /></span>
<span>Moves now among us his unburied part?<br /></span>
<span>What breast beats with the pulses of his heart?'<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&quot;&mdash;Vain thoughts are these that but a dying man<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Searches among the dark caves of his mind!<br /></span>
<span>But as I stood, the very wind that ran<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Between the files breathed more than common wind,<br /></span>
<span>As though the gods of men when Time began,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Fathers of fathers of old humankind,<br /></span>
<span>Startled, heard now the changeful future knock;<br /></span>
<span>And their lament it was from rock to rock<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&quot;Tossed with the wind's long echo ... O, speak not,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Nor tell me with my loss I am so dazed,<br /></span>
<span>That my tongue speaks unfaithfully my thought;<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>That you, you too, within his shadow raised,<br /></span>
<span>Stand bare now, wanting all you held or thought,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>By aimless love or prisoned grief amazed.<br /></span>
<span>Tell me not: let me out of silence speak,<br /></span>
<span>Or let me still my thoughts in silence break.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And so both stood, and not a word to say,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>By silence overborne, until at last<br /></span>
<span>The young man breathed, &quot;Look how the end of day<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Falls heavily, as though the earth were cast<br /></span>
<span>Into a shapeless soundless pit, where ray<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Of heavenly light never the verge has past.<br /></span>
<span>Yet will the late moon's light anon shine here,<br /></span>
<span>And then gray light, and then the sun's light clear.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&quot;Sire, 'twas my father died, and like night's pit<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Soundless and shapeless yawn my orphaned years.<br /></span>
<span>And yet I know morn comes and brings with it<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Old tasks again, and new joys, hopes and fears.<br /></span>
<span>Or sword or plough these fingers will find fit,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>And morrows end with other cries and tears,<br /></span>
<span>With women's arms and children's voices and<br /></span>
<span>The sacred gods blessing the new-sown land.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&quot;But look, upon your beard the dew is bright,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Chill is the winter fall: let us go in.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Then moved they slowly downward till a light<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Shining the door-post and thonged door between<br /></span>
<span>Showed the square Prince's House. Out of the night<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>They passed the sudden rubied warmth within.<br /></span>
<span>Curled shadowy by the wall a servant slept:<br /></span>
<span>A sleepy hound from the same corner crept.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Soon were they couched. The young man fell asleep;<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>While the old Prince drowsing uneasily,<br /></span>
<span>Tossing on the crest of agitations deep,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Dreamed waking, waking dreamed. Then memory<br /></span>
<span>The unseen hound, did from her corner creep<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Into his bosom and stirred him with her sigh<br /></span>
<span>Soundless. And he arose and answering pressed<br /></span>
<span>Her beloved head yet closer to his breast....<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Happy those years returned when first he strode<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Beside his father's knees, or climbed and felt<br /></span>
<span>The warm strength of those arms, or singing rode<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>High on his shoulders; or in winter pelt<br /></span>
<span>Of dread beasts wrapt, set as his father showed<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Snares in the frosty grass, and at dawn knelt<br /></span>
<span>Beside the snares, and shouting homeward tore,<br /></span>
<span>Winged with such pride as seldom manhood wore.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&mdash;How many, many, many years ago!<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>There was no older man now walked the earth.<br /></span>
<span>Had all those years sunk to a bitter glow,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Like the fire lingering yet upon the hearth?<br /></span>
<span>Ah, he might warm his hands there still, and so<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Must warm his heart now in this wintry dearth,<br /></span>
<span>Till the reluming sunken fire should give<br /></span>
<span>Warmth to his ageing wits and bid him live.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Even this house! It was his father told<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>How in the days half lost in icy time<br /></span>
<span>Men first forsook their wormy caves and cold<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>To build where the wind-footed cattle climb;<br /></span>
<span>And noise of labour broke the silence old<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>By such unbroken since the sparkling prime<br /></span>
<span>Of the world's spring. And so the house arose,<br /></span>
<span>A builded cave, perpetual as the snows<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>On the remotest summits of the range<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Hemming the north. Then house by house appeared<br /></span>
<span>'Neath valley-eaves, and change following on change<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Unnoted tamed earth's shaggy front. Men heard<br /></span>
<span>Strange voices syllabling with accents strange,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>By travellers breathed who, startled, paused and feared<br /></span>
<span>Seeing the smoke of habitations curled<br /></span>
<span>Above this hollow of an unrumoured world.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Startled, they paused and spoke by doubtful sign,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Answered by hesitating sign, until<br /></span>
<span>Moved one with aspect fearless and benign,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>And met one fearless, while all else hung still.<br /></span>
<span>And then was welcome, rest, and meat and wine<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>And intercourse of uncouth word, as shrill<br /></span>
<span>Voice with deep voice was mingled. So they stayed<br /></span>
<span>And to astonished eyes strange arts betrayed.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>By them the oarage of the wind was taught,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>And how the quick tail steered the cockled boat.<br /></span>
<span>They netted fruitful streams, and smiling brought<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Their breaking wickers home, too full to float.<br /></span>
<span>And opening the earth's rich womb they wrought<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Arms from the sullied ore; and labouring smote<br /></span>
<span>The mountain's bosom, till a path was seen<br /></span>
<span>Stony amid the flushed snow and flushed green.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Then first upon earth's wave the silver share<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Floated, by the teamed oxen drawn; then first<br /></span>
<span>Were seed-time rites, and harvest rites when bare<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>The cropped fields lay, and gathered tumult&mdash;nurst<br /></span>
<span>Long in the breasts of men that laboured there&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Now in the broad ease of fulfilment burst;<br /></span>
<span>And when the winter tasks failed in days chill,<br /></span>
<span>Weaving of bright-hued yarn, and chattering shrill;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And the loved tones of music sounded sweet<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Unwonted, when the new-stopped pipe was heard<br /></span>
<span>Rising and falling, and the falling feet<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Of sudden dancers. And old men were stirred<br /></span>
<span>With old men's memories of ancient heat<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>When youth sang in their bosoms like a bird....<br /></span>
<span>Sweet that divine musician, Memory,<br /></span>
<span>Fingering her many-reeded melody.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Then as he stared into the wasting glow<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>And watched the fire faint in the whitening wood,<br /></span>
<span>Came starker shadows moving vast and slow,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>And echoes of wild strife and smell of blood,<br /></span>
<span>Twitching of slain men, cries of parting woe,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Bruised bodies ghastly in the mountain flood;<br /></span>
<span>Burials and burnings, triumph with terrors blent,<br /></span>
<span>And widowed languors and night-long lament.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Like seeds long buried, these dead memories<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Upthrust in their new green and spread to flower:<br /></span>
<span>An eager child against his father's knees<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Leaning, he had listened many an evening hour.<br /></span>
<span>Now these remote reworded histories<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Entangled with his own renewed their power,<br /></span>
<span>Breathing an antique virtue through his mind,<br /></span>
<span>As through dense yew boughs breathes the undying wind.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Sighing, he rose up softly. On the wall<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>A dark shape shambled aimless to and fro;<br /></span>
<span>Head bent, eyes inward-seeing, rugged, tall,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Himself a shadow moved with musings slow<br /></span>
<span>Amid his cumbered past, and heard sweet call<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Of mother voice, and mother folk, and flow<br /></span>
<span>Of gentle and proud speech and tender laughter,<br /></span>
<span>Story and song, fault and forgiveness after;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And a voice graver, gentler than a man<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Might hear from any but a woman beloved,<br /></span>
<span>Stilling and awakening the blood that ran<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Like ocean tide, as neared she or removed ...<br /></span>
<span>Faded that music. Then a voice began<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Paining within his heart, yet unreproved;<br /></span>
<span>For dear the anguish is that steals upon<br /></span>
<span>A father's spirit lamenting his lost son.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&mdash;The latest born and latest lost of those<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Of his strong and her gentle being born.<br /></span>
<span>By earthquake, pestilence, by human foes<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Long were they dead; and yet not all forlorn<br /></span>
<span>He grieved, for at his side the youngest rose<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Bright as a willow gilded by dewy morn....<br /></span>
<span>Felled now the tree, silent that music, still<br /></span>
<span>The motion that did all the vale-air fill.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Once more they bore the body from the hunt<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Where he alone had died. Once more he heard<br /></span>
<span>The wail and sigh, and saw once more their front<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Of drooping grief; once more the wailing stirred<br /></span>
<span>Old hounds to baying wilder than was wont;<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Fell once more like slow, sullen rain each word<br /></span>
<span>Reluctant, telling to his senses strayed,<br /></span>
<span>How while the gods drowsed and men hung afraid.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Slain was the Prince unwary by the paw<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Of a springing beast that died in giving death.<br /></span>
<span>Again the featureless torn face he saw,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>The ribboned bosom emptied of warm breath;<br /></span>
<span>Again the circle sudden hush'd with awe,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>And smothered moaning heard the hush beneath.<br /></span>
<span>Again, again, and every night again,<br /></span>
<span>Vision renewed and voice recalled in vain.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Again those dear and lamentable rites<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Within the winter stems of forest shade,<br /></span>
<span>The pile, the smokeless flame, the thousand lights,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>The one light that in all the thousand played;<br /></span>
<span>Deep burthened voices while, around the heights<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Lifting, young trebles their wild echo made;<br /></span>
<span>Then the returning torches at the pyre<br /></span>
<span>Lit, when the eye glowed faint within the fire.<br /></span>

<span class='i1'>Sees sudden far below a strange land spread<br /></span>
<span>Immense; so from his lonely crag of Time<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>The Prince, his eye bewildered and adread,<br /></span>

<span>Cloud-racked, and changing even while he mused.<br /></span>

</div><div class='stanza'>

<span class='i1'>Sun-following, till surfeited with change,<br /></span>
<span>Mid idle pastures pitched or fabled town,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Subdued to climes and kings and customs strange,<br /></span>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&quot;Men say!&quot; he sighed, and from that lofty verge<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Of inward seeing drooped his doubtful sight.<br /></span>
<span>Sweet was it from such reverie to emerge<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>And breathe once more the thoughtless air of night,<br /></span>
<span>And watch the fire-slave through fresh billets urge<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>The sleeping flame, until the vivid light<br /></span>
<span>And toothed shadows wearied.... And then crept<br /></span>
<span>The hounds a little nearer, and all slept.<br /></span>
</div>
<hr style='width: 45%;' /><br />
<div class='stanza'>
<span>But the young man still lay in quiet sleep,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Or half-sleep, and a dream-born cloud enwreathed<br /></span>
<span>With memories, hopes and longings hidden deep<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>In his flown mind. Another air he breathed,<br /></span>
<span>Saw from an unsubstantial mountain sweep<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>In purest light, soon in low shadow sheathed,<br /></span>
<span>Semblance of faint-known faces, or beloved<br /></span>
<span>Daily-acquainted still, or long removed.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Even as sacred fire in fennel stalks<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Through windy ways is borne and densest night,<br /></span>
<span>Till where the outpost shivering sentry walks<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Beating the minutes into hours, the light<br /></span>
<span>Touches the guarded pile and, flaring, balks<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Beasts padding near and each unvisioned sprite<br /></span>
<span>By old dread apprehended; and new gladness<br /></span>
<span>Shakes in the village prone in winter sadness:&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>So through the young man's dream the kingly flame<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>In his own breast was undiminished borne.<br /></span>
<span>And other peoples catching from his fame<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>A noble heat, in neighbouring lands forlorn,<br /></span>
<span>Would glow with new power and the ancient name<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Bless, that had brightened through their narrow morn.<br /></span>
<span>And purer yet and steadier would pass on<br /></span>
<span>The sacred flame to son and son and son.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Or with contracting mind he saw the host<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Of mountain warriors banded, moving down<br /></span>
<span>Untrodden ways, as on young buds a frost<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Falls, and the spring lies stiff. The air was sown<br /></span>
<span>With strife, the fields with blood, the night with ghost<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Wandering by ghost, and wounded men were strown<br /></span>
<span>Surprised, unweaponed; and chill air congealed<br /></span>
<span>Each hurt, and with the blood their breath was sealed.<br /></span>

<span>Approached, and brandished their rich trophied spears.<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Sweet the pipes' spearlike music, sweet and loud,<br /></span>

<span class='i1'>Sweet the dance unto smiling gods new vowed,<br /></span>

<span class='i1'>And the long caravan o'er the ford all day<br /></span>
<span>And all day and all day pass; while the tide slept<br /></span>
<span>In sluggish shallows, or through marsh-reeds crept.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>So would they on and on, with death and birth<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>For wayfellows and nightly stars for guide,<br /></span>
<span>While seasons bloomed and faded on the earth,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>And jealous gods their wandering gods would chide.<br /></span>
<span>Until, weary of endless going forth<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Dark-locust-like, the old fret would subside,<br /></span>

<span>&quot;In this full-rivered pasture let us lie!<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>&quot;Here let us lie, and wanderings be at rest!&quot;<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Midmost a cedar grove high sacrifice<br /></span>

<span>Crept the same dream and lifted on new wing<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>And took from his swift passions a new stain,<br /></span>
<span>Sanguine and azure, and first fluttering<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Rose then on easy vans that bore again<br /></span>
<span>The sleeper past his common thought's confine:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>So borne, so soaring, in that air divine,<br /></span>

<span>He saw his people stayed, their journeys ended....<br /></span>

<span class='i1'>And interweaved swift steps the meadow through,<br /></span>
<span>Old rites revived; they bore the shapen god<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>With green stalks and first-budded boughs, and drew<br /></span>
<span>Together youth and age. And sowers leapt<br /></span>
<span>High o'er the seed in earth's cold bosom wrapt:&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>So in the golden-hued and burning hours<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Of harvest, leapt on high the full-eared corn.<br /></span>
<span>Friendly to pious hands those imaged Powers<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Of rain and sun. And when the grain was borne<br /></span>
<span>By oxen trailing tangled straws and flowers,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>With leaves and dying blossoms on each horn,<br /></span>

<span>Like summer's golden moon:&mdash;in wise and fool,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Noble and mean, accustomed reverence showed<br /></span>

<span>Of bardic chanting, bidding their thoughts descend<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Into the chamber where the Past lay bound,<br /></span>
<span>Wanting but music's finger; so upspringing,<br /></span>

<span class='i1'>From birds' breasts quivering in tall woodland trees<br /></span>

<span>That is the earliest thing that I remember&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The narrow house in the long narrow street,<br /></span>
<span>Dark rooms within and darkness out of doors<br /></span>
<span>Where grasses in the garden lift in the wind,<br /></span>
<span>Long grasses clinging round unsteady feet.<br /></span>
<span>The sunlight through one narrow passage pours,<br /></span>
<span>As through the keyhole into a dusty room,<br /></span>
<span>Striking with a golden rod the greening gloom.<br /></span>
<span>The tall, tall timber-stacks have yet been kind,<br /></span>
<span>Letting the sun fling his rod clear between,<br /></span>
<span>Lest there should be no gold upon the green,<br /></span>
<span>And no light then for a child to dream upon,<br /></span>
<span>And day be of day's brightness all forlorn.<br /></span>
<span>I saw those timber piles first dark and tall,<br /></span>
<span>And then men clambered up, and stumbled down,<br /></span>
<span>Each with a heavy and long timber borne<br /></span>
<span>Upon broad shoulders, leather-covered, bent.<br /></span>
<span>Hour after hour, day after day they went,<br /></span>
<span>Until the piles were gone and a new sky<br /></span>
<span>Stretched high and white above the garden wall.<br /></span>
<span>And then fresh piles crept slowly up and up,<br /></span>
<span>The strong men staggering, more cruelly bowed,<br /></span>
<span>Till at last they lay idle on the top<br /></span>
<span>Looking down from their height on things so small,<br /></span>
<span>While I looked wondering and fearful up<br /></span>
<span>At the strong men at rest on the new-built cloud.<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>But there was other gold than the sun's sparse gold&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Florence's hair, its brightness lying still<br /></span>
<span>Upon my mind as then upon the grass.<br /></span>

</div><div class='stanza'>

<span>Edged by the timber piles so black and tall.<br /></span>
<span>From the rotten fence I watched the horses pull<br /></span>
<span>Along the footpath, slow and beautiful,<br /></span>
<span>Moving with strength and ease, in their great size<br /></span>
<span>And untired movement wonderful to my eyes;<br /></span>
<span>Their dull brass clanking as each shaggy foot<br /></span>
<span>Stamped the soft cinder track as fine as soot.<br /></span>
<span>The driver lurched old and forbidding by,<br /></span>
<span>Not seeing the child that feared to meet his eye.<br /></span>
<span>I watched the rope dip, tighten, and the water flash<br /></span>
<span>In falling, and then heard the hiss and splash;<br /></span>
<span>I watched the barge drag slowly on and on,<br /></span>
<span>Not dreaming how lovely a ship could ride the water upon,<br /></span>
<span>Not dreaming how lovely flowing water was,<br /></span>

<span>Pile to pile gave its fire, till they were like<br /></span>
<span>Bright angels with flashing swords before they strike,<br /></span>
<span>Terrible and lovely. But men those angels fought,<br /></span>
<span>Small and humble and patient all night wrought,<br /></span>

<span>Then their black spectres haunted the waterside,<br /></span>
<span>Charred ruins, broken-limbed, no more erect,<br /></span>
<span>Or heaped black dust, with cold white ashes flecked.<br /></span>
<span>But I had seen the angel-quelling men,<br /></span>
<span>With blackened and bruised face, the horses thin,<br /></span>
<span>The glittering harness, the leaky, bubbling mains,<br /></span>

<span>Winter was weary. All his snows were failing&mdash;<br /></span>

<span>Upon the grasses, bushes and broad hedges,<br /></span>
<span>But all was lost in the new touch of Time.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And the bright-glob&egrave;d hedges were all ruddy,<br /></span>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>In the soft wind, no more afraid of Winter.<br /></span>
<span>Nor chaffinch, wren, nor lark was now afraid.<br /></span>
<span>And Winter heard, or (ears too hard of hearing)<br /></span>
<span>Snuffed the South-West that in his cold hair played.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And his hands trembled. Then with voice a-quaver<br /></span>
<span>He called the East Wind, and the black East ran,<br /></span>
<span>Roofing the sky with iron, and in the darkness<br /></span>
<span>Winter crept out and chilled the earth again.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And while men slept the still pools were frozen,<br /></span>
<span>Mosses were white, with ice the long grasses bowed;<br /></span>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And men and beasts were dulled, and children even<br /></span>

<span>Early the patient rooks and starlings gathered;<br /></span>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And Winter laughed, but the third night grew weary,<br /></span>
<span>And slept all heavy, till the East Wind thought him dead.<br /></span>
<span>Then the returning South West in his nostrils<br /></span>
<span>Breathed, and his snows melted. And his head<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Uplifting, he saw all the laughing valley,<br /></span>

<span>Broadening over the meadows; saw the sun running<br /></span>
<span>From hill to hill and glittering upon the town.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>All day he stared. But his head drooped at evening,<br /></span>
<span>Bent and slow he stumbled into the white<br /></span>

<span>And in its darkness found a darker night<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>

</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Old men at night dreamed that they saw him going,<br /></span>

<span>And the young women woke from dreams that burn.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And children going through the fields at morning<br /></span>
<span>Saw the unloosened waters leaping down,<br /></span>

<span class='i1'>Over green-hued rock, then plunging to its pool<br /></span>

<span class='i1'>Water falling golden from the sun but moonlike cool:<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>

<span class='i1'>Water falls as straight as her body rose,<br /></span>
<span>Water her brightness has from neck to still feet,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Water crystal-cold as her cold body flows.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>But not water has the colour I saw when I dreamed,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Nor water such strength has. I joyed to behold<br /></span>
<span>How the blood lit her body with lamps of fire<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>And made the flesh glow that like water gleamed cold.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>

<span class='i1'>From foot to head did flame into red flame flow.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>I knew how beauty seen from unseen must rise,<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>How the body's joy for more than body's use was made.<br /></span>

<span class='i1'>And how the mind's own fire beneath the cool skin played.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>O shape that once to have seen is to see evermore,<br /></span>

<span>Rose slowly and then, darkening, made him wise and blind&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>So that he saw no more the level sun,<br /></span>
<span>Nor the small solid shadow of unclouded noon.<br /></span>
<span>The dark green heights rose slowly from the green<br /></span>
<span>Of the dark water till the sky was narrowly seen;<br /></span>
<span>Only at night the lifting walls were still,<br /></span>
<span>And stars were bright and calm above each calm dark hill.<br /></span>
<span>... I could not think but that a God grown old<br /></span>
<span>Saw in a dream or waking all this round of bold<br /></span>
<span>And wavelike hills, and knew them but a thought,<br /></span>
<span>Or but a wave uptost and poised awhile then caught<br /></span>
<span>Back to the sea with waves a million more<br /></span>
<span>That rise and pause and break at last upon the shore.<br /></span>
<span>A God, a God saw first those hills that I<br /></span>
<span>Saw now immense upholding the starry crowded sky:<br /></span>

<span>Ere mine his thought failed under each rough height<br /></span>
<span>And then was brave, seeing the stars climb calm and bright.<br /></span>
<span>Ere they were named he named them in his mood,<br /></span>
<span>Like varying children of one giant warring brood&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Broad-Foot, Cloud-Gatherer, Long-Back, Winter-Head,<br /></span>
<span>Bravery and Bright-Face and that long Home of the Dead;<br /></span>
<span>And their still waters glittering in his glance<br /></span>
<span>Named Buckler, Silver Dish, Two Eyes and Shining Lance,<br /></span>
<span>Names unrecorded, but the circling wind<br /></span>
<span>Remembers and repeats them to the listening mind....<br /></span>
<span>That mind was mine. At Shining Lance I stared<br /></span>
<span>Between Long-Back and Winter-Head as the new sun bared<br /></span>
<span>The Lake and heights of shadow and the wan gold<br /></span>
<span>Deepened and new warmth came into the light's sharp cold.<br /></span>
<span>And the near trees shivered no more but shook<br /></span>
<span>Their music over Shining Lance; and the excited brook<br /></span>
<span>Freshened in the sun's eye and tossed his spray<br /></span>
<span>High and sparkling, and then sprang dancing, dancing away.<br /></span>
<span>But Winter-Head and Long-Back, gravely bright,<br /></span>
<span>Stood firm as if for ever and a day and a night&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>As they were more than a wave before 'tis caught<br /></span>
<span>Back to the tossing tide, more than a flying thought,<br /></span>
<span>More than a dream that an old God once dreamed<br /></span>
<span>When visionary not at all visionary seemed.<br /></span>

<span>If Love was born in that bright April sky<br /></span>
<span>And ran unheeding when the sun was high,<br /></span>
<span>And slept as the moon sleeps through Autumn nights<br /></span>
<span>While those dear steady stars burn in their heights:<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>If Love so lived and ran and slept and woke<br /></span>

<span>But Winter after Autumn comes and stills<br /></span>
<span>The petulant waters and the wild mind fills<br /></span>

<span>With all that was, is and draws darkling nearer.<br /></span>

<span>The pigeons, following the faint warm light,<br /></span>
<span>Stayed at last on the roof till warmth was gone,<br /></span>
<span>Then in the mist that's hastier than night<br /></span>
<span>Disappeared all behind the carved dark stone,<br /></span>
<span>Huddling from the black cruelty of the frost.<br /></span>
<span>With the new sparkling sun they swooped and came<br /></span>
<span>Like a cloud between the sun and street, and then<br /></span>
<span>Like a cloud blown from the blue north were lost,<br /></span>
<span>Vanishing and returning ever again,<br /></span>
<span>Small cloud following cloud across the flame<br /></span>
<span>That clear and meagre burned and burned away<br /></span>
<span>And left the ice unmelting day by day.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>... Nor could the sun through the roof's purple slate<br /></span>
<span>(Though his gold magic played with shadow there<br /></span>
<span>And drew the pigeons from the streaming air)<br /></span>
<span>With any fiery magic penetrate.<br /></span>
<span>Under the roof the air and water froze,<br /></span>
<span>And no smoke from the gaping chimney rose.<br /></span>
<span>The silver frost upon the window-pane<br /></span>
<span>Flowered and branched each starving night anew,<br /></span>
<span>And stranger, lovelier and crueller grew;<br /></span>
<span>Pouring her silver that cold silver through,<br /></span>
<span>The moon made all the dim flower bright again.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>... Pouring her silver through that barren flower<br /></span>
<span>Of silver frost, until it filled and whitened<br /></span>
<span>A room where two small children waited, frightened<br /></span>
<span>At the pale ghost of light that hour by hour<br /></span>
<span>Stared at them till though fear slept not they slept.<br /></span>
<span>And when that white ghost from the window crept,<br /></span>
<span>And day came and they woke and saw all plain,<br /></span>
<span>Though still the frost-flower blinded the window-pane,<br /></span>
<span>And touched their mother and touched her hand in vain,<br /></span>
<span>And wondered why she woke not when they woke;<br /></span>
<span>And wondered what it was their sleep that broke<br /></span>
<span>When hand in hand they stared and stared, so frightened;<br /></span>
<span>They feared and waited, and waited all day long<br /></span>
<span>While all the shadows went and the day brightened,<br /></span>
<span>All the ill shadows but one shadow strong.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Outside were busy feet and human speech<br /></span>
<span>And daily cries and horns. Maybe they heard,<br /></span>
<span>Painfully wondering still, and each to each<br /></span>
<span>Leaning, and listening if their mother stirred&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Cold, cold,<br /></span>
<span>Hungering as the long slow hours grew old,<br /></span>
<span>Though food within the cupboard idle lay<br /></span>
<span>Beyond their thought, or but beyond their reach.<br /></span>
<span>The soft blue pigeons all the afternoon<br /></span>
<span>Sunned themselves on the roof or rose at play,<br /></span>
<span>Then with the shrinking light fluttered away;<br /></span>
<span>And once more came the icy hearted moon,<br /></span>
<span>Staring down at the frightened children there<br /></span>
<span>That could but shiver and stare.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>... How many hours, how many days, who knows?<br /></span>
<span>Neighbours there were who thought they had gone away<br /></span>
<span>To return some luckier or luckless day.<br /></span>
<span>No sound came from the room: the cold air froze<br /></span>
<span>The very echo of the children's sighs.<br /></span>
<span>And what they saw within each other's eyes,<br /></span>
<span>Or heard each other's heart say as they peered<br /></span>
<span>At the dead mother lying there, and feared<br /></span>
<span>That she might wake, and then might never wake,<br /></span>
<span>Who knows, who knows?<br /></span>
<span>None heard a living sound their silence break.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>In those cold days and nights how many birds<br /></span>
<span>Flittering above the fields and streams all frozen<br /></span>
<span>Watched hungrily the tended flocks and herds&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Earth's chosen nourished by earth's wise self-chosen!<br /></span>
<span>How many birds suddenly stiffened and died<br /></span>
<span>With no plaint cried,<br /></span>
<span>The starved heart ceasing when the pale sun ceased!<br /></span>
<span>And when the new day stepped from the same cold East<br /></span>
<span>The dead birds lay in the light on the snow-flecked field,<br /></span>
<span>Their song and beautiful free winging stilled.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>I walked under snow-sprinkled hills at night,<br /></span>
<span>And starry sprinkled, skies deep blue and bright.<br /></span>
<span>The keen wind thrust with his knife against the thin<br /></span>
<span>Breast of the wood as I went tingling by<br /></span>
<span>And heard a weak cheep-cheep&mdash;no more&mdash;the cry<br /></span>
<span>Of a bird that crouched the smitten wood within....<br /></span>
<span>But no one heeded that sharp spiritual cry<br /></span>
<span>Of the two children in their misery,<br /></span>
<span>When in the cold and famished night death's shade<br /></span>
<span>More terrible the moon's cold shadows made.<br /></span>
<span>How was it none could hear<br /></span>
<span>That bodiless crying, birdlike, sharp and clear?<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>I cannot think what they, unanswered, thought<br /></span>
<span>When the night came again and shadows moved<br /></span>
<span>As the moon through the ice-flower stared and roved,<br /></span>
<span>And that unyielding Shadow came again.<br /></span>
<span>That Shadow came again unseen and caught<br /></span>
<span>The children as they sat listening in vain,<br /></span>
<span>Their starved hearts failing ere the Shadow removed.<br /></span>
<span>And when the new morn stepped from the same cold East<br /></span>
<span>They lay unawakening in the barren light,<br /></span>
<span>Their song and their imaginations bright,<br /></span>
<span>Their pains and fears and all bewilderment ceased....<br /></span>
<span>While the brief sun gave<br /></span>
<span>New beauty to the death-flower of the frost,<br /></span>
<span>And pigeons in the frore air swooped and tossed,<br /></span>
<span>And glad eyes were more glad and grave less grave.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>There is not pity enough in heaven or earth,<br /></span>
<span>There is not love enough, if children die<br /></span>
<span>Like famished birds&mdash;oh, less mercifully.<br /></span>
<span>A great wrong's done when such as these go forth<br /></span>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<span>At evening when the aspens rustled soft<br /></span>
<span>And the last blackbird by the hedge-nest laughed,<br /></span>
<span>And through the leaves the moon's unmeaning face<br /></span>
<span>Looked, and then rose in dark-blue leafless space;<br /></span>
<span>Watching the trees and moon she could not bear<br /></span>
<span>The silence and the presence everywhere.<br /></span>
<span>The blackbird called the silence and it came<br /></span>
<span>Closing and closing round like smoke round flame.<br /></span>
<span>Into her heart it crept and the heart was numb,<br /></span>
<span>Even wishes died, and all but fear was dumb&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Fear and its phantoms. Then the trees were enlarged,<br /></span>
<span>And from their roundness unguessed shapes emerged,<br /></span>
<span>Or no shape but the image of her fear<br /></span>
<span>Creeping forth from her mind and hovering near.<br /></span>
<span>If a bat flitted it was an evil thing;<br /></span>
<span>Sadder the trees grew with every shadowy wing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Their shape enlarged, their arms quivered, their thought<br /></span>
<span>Stirring in the leaves a silent anguish wrought.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;What are they thinking of, the evil trees,<br /></span>
<span>Nod-nodding, standing in malignant ease?<br /></span>
<span>Something against man's mortal heart was sworn<br /></span>
<span>Once, when their dark Powers were conceived and born;<br /></span>
<span>And in such fading or such lightless hours<br /></span>
<span>The world is delivered to these plotting Powers.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>No physical swift blow she dreaded, not<br /></span>
<span>Lightning's quick mercy; but her heart grew hot<br /></span>
<span>And cold and hot with uncomprehended sense<br /></span>
<span>Of an assassin spiritual influence<br /></span>
<span>Moving in the unmoving trees....<br /></span>
<span class='i8'>Till, as she stared,<br /></span>
<span>Her eyes turned cowards at last, and no more dared.<br /></span>
<span>Yet could she never rise and shut the door:<br /></span>
<span>Perhaps those Powers would batter at the door,<br /></span>
<span>And that were madness. So right through the house<br /></span>
<span>She set the doors all wide when she could arouse<br /></span>
<span>The body's energy to serve the mind.<br /></span>
<span>Then the air would move, and any little wind<br /></span>
<span>Would cleanse awhile the darkness and diminish<br /></span>
<span>Her fear, and the dumb shadow-war would finish.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i2'>But it was not the trees, the birds, the moon;<br /></span>
<span>Birds cease, months fly, green seasons wither soon:<br /></span>
<span>Nature was constant all the seasons through,<br /></span>
<span>Sinister, watchful, and a thick cloud drew<br /></span>
<span>Over the mind when its simplicity<br /></span>
<span>Challenged what seemed with thought of what must be....<br /></span>
<span>She wondered, seeing how a child could play<br /></span>
<span>Lightly in a shady field all day:<br /></span>
<span>For in that golden, brief, benignant weather<br /></span>
<span>When spring and summer calling run together<br /></span>
<span>And the sun's fresh and hot, she saw deep guile<br /></span>
<span>In the sweetness of that unconditioned smile.<br /></span>
<span>Sweetness not sweetness was but indifference<br /></span>
<span>Or wantonness disguised, to her grave sense;<br /></span>
<span>And if she could have seen the things she felt<br /></span>
<span>She'd looked for darkness, and lit shapes that knelt<br /></span>
<span>Appealing, unregarded, at a high<br /></span>
<span>Altar uprising from the pit to the sky....<br /></span>
<span>Had the trees consciousness, with flowers and clouds<br /></span>
<span>And winds that hung like thin clouds in the woods,<br /></span>
<span>And stars and silence:&mdash;had they each a mind<br /></span>
<span>Bending on hers, clear eyes on her eyes blind?<br /></span>
<span>In the green dense heights&mdash;elm, oak, ash, yew or beech<br /></span>
<span>She scarce saw&mdash;was there not a brain in each,<br /></span>
<span>An undiscovered centre of quick nerves<br /></span>
<span>By which (like man) the tree lives, masters, serves,<br /></span>
<span>Waxes and wanes? Oppressed her mind would shrink<br /></span>
<span>From thought, and into her trembling body sink.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i2'>Something of this had childhood taught her when<br /></span>
<span>Sickly she lay and peered again and again<br /></span>
<span>At gray skies and white skies and void bright blue,<br /></span>
<span>And watched the sun the bare town-tree boughs through,<br /></span>
<span>And then through leafy boughs and once more bare.<br /></span>
<span>Or in the west country's heavy hill-drawn air<br /></span>
<span>Had felt the green grass pushing within her veins,<br /></span>
<span>Tangling and strangling: and the warm spring rains<br /></span>
<span>Tapping all night upon her childish head:<br /></span>
<span>She shivered, lying lonely on her bed,<br /></span>
<span>With all that life all round and she so weak,<br /></span>
<span>Longing to speak&mdash;yet what was there to speak?<br /></span>
<span>And as she grew and health came and love came<br /></span>
<span>And life was happier, happier, still the same<br /></span>
<span>Inhuman spirit rose whenever she<br /></span>
<span>Held in her thoughts more than her eyes could see.<br /></span>
<span>Behind the happiest hours the dark cloud hung<br /></span>
<span>Distant or nearing, and its dullness flung<br /></span>
<span>On the south meadows of her thought, the fairest<br /></span>
<span>Shrinking in shadow; aspirations rarest<br /></span>
<span>Falling, like shot birds in a reedy fen,<br /></span>
<span>Slain by the old Enemy of men.<br /></span>
<span>Life ebbed while men strove for the means of life;<br /></span>
<span>The grudging earth turned labour into strife.<br /></span>
<span>The moving hosts within the heavy clod<br /></span>
<span>Seemed infinite in malice; frost and flood,<br /></span>
<span>Season and inter-season, were conspired<br /></span>
<span>In smiling or sour mockery; and untired<br /></span>
<span>And undelighted, man scratched and scratched on,<br /></span>
<span>And what he did, by Nature was undone.<br /></span>
<span>She saw men twisted more than rocks or trees,<br /></span>
<span>Bruised, numbed, by age and labour and the disease<br /></span>
<span>Of labour in the cold fields; women worn<br /></span>
<span>By many child-bearings, and their self-scorn<br /></span>
<span>Because of time and their lost woman's powers.<br /></span>
<span>Bitter was Nature to women; for those hours<br /></span>
<span>Of the spirit's and the body's first delight<br /></span>
<span>Passed soon, and the long day, evening, night<br /></span>
<span>Of life uncherished; bitterest when even<br /></span>
<span>That brief hour was denied, of dancing heaven,<br /></span>
<span>Dewy love, and fulfilled desires.<br /></span>
<span class='i10'>But age<br /></span>
<span>Of all ills made her pity and anger rage.<br /></span>
<span>To see and smell the calm months bud and bloom,<br /></span>
<span>April's first warmth, June's hues and slow perfume,<br /></span>
<span>The sweetness drifting by in those long hours<br /></span>
<span>While, out of her she nursed, the vital powers<br /></span>
<span>Were pressed by pain and pressed by pain renewed,<br /></span>
<span>Till, closing the life-long vicissitude,<br /></span>
<span>Came starving death with full-heaped summer, and<br /></span>
<span>Wrung the last pangs that spirit could withstand ...<br /></span>
<span>Or to see age in its prison slowly freeze<br /></span>
<span>With impotence more disastrous than disease,<br /></span>
<span>While trees flowered on, or all the winter through<br /></span>
<span>Upheld brave arms and with spring flowered anew<br /></span>
<span>Above those living graves and graves of the dead;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>'Twas all such bitterness, but she nothing said.<br /></span>
<span>She saw men as courageous boats that sailed<br /></span>
<span>On all the seas, and some a far port hailed<br /></span>
<span>Perhaps to sail again, or anchor there<br /></span>
<span>Forever; some would quietly disappear<br /></span>
<span>In stormless waters, and some in storms be broken<br /></span>
<span>And all be hidden and no clear meaning spoken,<br /></span>
<span>Nor any trace upon the waters linger.<br /></span>
<span>Where the boat went the wind with hasty finger,<br /></span>
<span>Savage and sly as aught of land could be,<br /></span>
<span>Erased the little wrinkling of the sea.<br /></span>
<span>O, in such enmity was man enisled,<br /></span>
<span>Such loneliness, by foolish shades beguiled,<br /></span>
<span>That it was bravery to see and live,<br /></span>
<span>But cowardice to see and to forgive,<br /></span>
<span>The wrong of evil, the wrong of death to life,<br /></span>
<span>The defeat of innocence, the waste of strife,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The heavy ills of time, injustice, pain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>In field and forest and flood rose huge and plain,<br /></span>
<span>Brushing her mind with darkness, till she thought<br /></span>
<span>Not with her brain, but all her nerves were wrought<br /></span>
<span>Into an apprehension burning strong,<br /></span>
<span>Unslackening, of mortality's old wrong.<br /></span>
<span>But if her eyes she raised to those clear lonely<br /></span>
<span>Altitudes of stars and ether only,<br /></span>
<span>Her eyes fell and rebuked her as forbidden<br /></span>
<span>With human mind to question what was hidden.<br /></span>
<span>At summer dusk the broad moon rising high<br /></span>
<span>Put gentleness in the vast strength of the sky,<br /></span>
<span>Easing its weight; or the hot summer sun<br /></span>
<span>Made noonday kind, and the hours lightly run.<br /></span>
<span>But in those blazing midnights of the stars<br /></span>
<span>Gathered and brightening for immortal wars<br /></span>
<span>With spears and darts and arrows of sharp light,<br /></span>
<span>She read the indifference of the infinite,<br /></span>
<span>The high strife flashing through eternity<br /></span>
<span>While on the earth stared mortals but as she.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i2'>O 'twas a living world that rose around<br /></span>
<span>And in her sentience burned a hollow wound.<br /></span>
<span>Such easy brightness as the poets see,<br /></span>
<span>Or easy gloom, or hues of faerie,<br /></span>
<span>She never saw, but into her own heart peered<br /></span>
<span>To find what spirit indeed it was she feared:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Whether in antique days a divine foe<br /></span>
<span>Sprung branchlike from dense woods had wrought her woe;<br /></span>
<span>Whether in antique days a pagan rite<br /></span>

<span>The same blood in ancestral veins ran fleet<br /></span>
<span>As now made hers a road for pain's quick feet.<br /></span>
<span>Into the marrow of her hidden life<br /></span>
<span>Had poured the agony of their termless strife<br /></span>
<span>With immaterial and material things;<br /></span>
<span>And as a bird an unlearned music sings<br /></span>
<span>Because a million generations sang,<br /></span>

<span>So the old sorrowfulness in her thought<br /></span>
<span>Renewed, and apprehensions all untaught;<br /></span>
<span>As if indeed a creature primitive<br /></span>
<span>Still did she in the world's dim morning live,<br /></span>
<span>That wanted human warmth and gentleness<br /></span>
<span>To make its solitude a little less.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span class='i2'>Kindness gave solitude the lovely light<br /></span>
<span>She loved, and made less terrible black midnight.<br /></span>
<span>Even as a bird its unlearned music pours<br /></span>
<span>Though windows all be blind and shut the doors,<br /></span>
<span>And sings on still though no faint sound be heard<br /></span>
<span>But wind and leaves and another lonely bird:<br /></span>
<span>So poured she untaught kindness all around<br /></span>

<span>Music her own and music heard from others,<br /></span>
<span>Prime music of all lovers, children, mothers,<br /></span>

<span>Another's chilly smile or peevish frown,<br /></span>
<span>I caught their talk&mdash;but added none of mine.<br /></span>
<span>They said how she still fumbled with her fate,<br /></span>
<span>How she had banished visitants divine,<br /></span>
<span>How long her sleep had been, her sloth how great,<br /></span>
<span>How others had drawn near and passed her by,<br /></span>
<span>While she luxuriously had dreamed, dreamed on,<br /></span>
<span>She, she her own eternal enemy,<br /></span>
<span>And wanting brain, brain, brain would be undone.<br /></span>

<span>To talk of other things&mdash;another's wife,<br /></span>
<span>Money that ministers to a mind diseased,<br /></span>

<span>I saw the sharp green hills, the silver clouds<br /></span>
<span>At rest upon the hills, the silver streams<br /></span>
<span>Creeping between prone shoulders of dark woods.<br /></span>
<span>I saw wide marshlands laved with level beams<br /></span>
<span>Of the last light; I saw ships on the sea<br /></span>
<span>That foamed hard by, stinging the fretful shore;<br /></span>
<span>I smelt old ships on the deserted quay<br /></span>
<span>That English sailors sailed, and will no more;<br /></span>

<span>That answered&mdash;&quot;O, I know, I know, I know!<br /></span>

<span>Last night a sword-light in the sky<br /></span>
<span>Flashed a swift terror on the dark.<br /></span>
<span>In that sharp light the fields did lie<br /></span>
<span>Naked and stone-like; each tree stood<br /></span>
<span>Like a tranced woman, bound and stark.<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Far off the wood<br /></span>
<span>With darkness ridged the riven dark.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And cows astonished stared with fear,<br /></span>
<span>And sheep crept to the knees of cows,<br /></span>
<span>And conies to their burrows slid,<br /></span>
<span>And rooks were still in rigid boughs,<br /></span>
<span>And all things else were still or hid.<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>From all the wood<br /></span>
<span>Came but the owl's hoot, ghostly, clear.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>In that cold trance the earth was held<br /></span>
<span>It seemed an age, or time was nought.<br /></span>
<span>Sure never from that stone-like field<br /></span>
<span>Sprang golden corn, nor from those chill<br /></span>
<span>Gray granite trees was music wrought.<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>In all the wood<br /></span>
<span>Even the tall poplar hung stone still.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>It seemed an age, or time was none ...<br /></span>
<span>Slowly the earth heaved out of sleep<br /></span>
<span>And shivered, and the trees of stone<br /></span>
<span>Bent and sighed in the gusty wind,<br /></span>
<span>And rain swept as birds flocking sweep.<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>Far off the wood<br /></span>
<span>Rolled the slow thunders on the wind.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>From all the wood came no brave bird,<br /></span>
<span>No song broke through the close-fall'n night,<br /></span>
<span>Nor any sound from cowering herd:<br /></span>
<span>Only a dog's long lonely howl<br /></span>
<span>When from the window poured pale light.<br /></span>
<span class='i1'>And from the wood<br /></span>
<span>The hoot came ghostly of the owl.<br /></span>

<span>Into the empty night goes lonely she,<br /></span>

<span>Trembling with change and fear of counterchange?<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>O, not earth trembles, but the stars, the stars!<br /></span>
<span>The sky is shaken and the cool air is quivering.<br /></span>
<span>I cannot look up to the crowded height<br /></span>

<span>For thinking of the starlike spirits of men<br /></span>

<span>Because on my own land a shadow lies<br /></span>

<span>There was no murmur on the seas,<br /></span>
<span>No wind blew&mdash;only the wandering air that grows<br /></span>
<span>With dawn, then murmurs, sighs,<br /></span>
<span>And dies.<br /></span>
<span>The mist climbed slowly, putting out the stars,<br /></span>
<span>And the earth trembled when the stars were gone;<br /></span>
<span>And moving strangely everywhere upon<br /></span>
<span>The trembling earth, thickened the watery mist.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And for a time the holy things are veiled.<br /></span>
<span>England's wise thoughts are swords; her quiet hours<br /></span>

<span>In starless night<br /></span>
<span>A serious passion streams the heaven with light.<br /></span>

<span>The heart of England throbbing everywhere.<br /></span>
<span>And all her roads are nerves of noble thought,<br /></span>

<span>Hath sought to bruise the brain, the sensitive will,<br /></span>
<span>The conscience of the world,<br /></span>
<span>For this, England, art risen, and shalt fight<br /></span>
<span>Purely through long profoundest night,<br /></span>
<span>Making their quarrel thine who are grieved like thee;<br /></span>

<span>The stars again and all their peace again.<br /></span>
<span>The moving mist had gone, and shining still<br /></span>

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<span>I heard a boy that climbed up Dover's Hill<br /></span>
<span>Singing <i>Sweet England</i>, sweeter for his song.<br /></span>
<span>The notes crept muffled through the copse, but still<br /></span>
<span>Sharply recalled the things forgotten long,<br /></span>
<span>The music that my own boy's lips had known,<br /></span>
<span>Singing, and old airs on a wild flute blown;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And other hills, more grim and lonely far,<br /></span>
<span>And valleys empty of these orchard trees;<br /></span>
<span>A sheep-pond filled with the moon, a single star<br /></span>
<span>I had watched by night searching the wreckful seas;<br /></span>
<span>And all the streets and streets that childhood knew<br /></span>
<span>In years when London streets were all my view.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And I remembered how that song I heard,<br /></span>
<span><i>Sweet England</i>, sung by children on May-day,<br /></span>
<span>Nor any song was sweeter of a bird<br /></span>
<span>Than that half-grievous air from children gay&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>For then, as now, youth made the sadness bright,<br /></span>
<span>Till the words, <i>Sweet, Sweet England</i>, shone with light.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Now, listening, I forgot how men yet fought<br /></span>
<span>For this same England, till the song was done<br /></span>
<span>And no sound lingered but the lark's, that brought<br /></span>
<span>New music down from fields of cloud and sun,<br /></span>
<span>Or the sad lapwing's over fields of green<br /></span>
<span>Crying beneath the copse, near but unseen.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Then I remembered. All wide England spread<br /></span>
<span>Before me, hill and wood and meadow and stream<br /></span>
<span>And ancient roads and homes of men long dead,<br /></span>
<span>And all the beauty a familiar dream.<br /></span>
<span>On the green hills a cloud of silver grey<br /></span>
<span>Gave gentle light stranger than light of day.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And clear between the hills, past the near crest<br /></span>
<span>And many hills, the hungry cities crept,<br /></span>
<span>Noble and mean, oppressive and oppressed,<br /></span>
<span>Where dreams unrealized of England slept:<br /></span>
<span>And they too England, packed in dusty street<br /></span>
<span>With men that half forgot England was sweet.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>Now men were far, but like a living brain<br /></span>
<span>Quick with their thought, the earth, hills, air and light<br /></span>
<span>Were quivering as though a shining rain<br /></span>
<span>Falling all round made even the light more bright;<br /></span>
<span>And trees and water and heath and hedge-flowers fair<br /></span>
<span>With more than natural sweetness washed the air.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>From hill to hill a sparkling web it swung,<br /></span>
<span>A snare for happiness, lit with lovely dews.<br /></span>
<span>The very smoke of cities now was hung<br /></span>
<span>But like a grave girl's dress of tranquil hues:<br /></span>
<span>And how (I thought) can England, seen thus bright,<br /></span>
<span>Lifting her clear frank head, but love the light?&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>No, not her brain! that bright web was the shadow<br /></span>
<span>Of the high spirit in their spirit shining<br /></span>
<span>Who on scarred foreign hill and trench&egrave;d meadow<br /></span>
<span>Kept the faith yet, unfearful, unrepining;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Her faith that with the dark world's liberty<br /></span>
<span>Mingles as earth's great rivers with the sea.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>O with what gilding ray was the land agleam!<br /></span>
<span>It was not sun and dew, bush, bough and leaf,<br /></span>
<span>But human spirits visible as in a dream<br /></span>
<span>That turns from glad to aching, being too brief:<br /></span>
<span>Courage and beauty shining in such brightness<br /></span>
<span>That all the thoughtful woods were no more lightless.<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>But most the hills a splendour had put on<br /></span>
<span>Of golden honour, bright and high and calm<br /></span>
<span>And like old heroes young men dream upon<br /></span>
<span>When midnight stirs with magic sword and palm;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>With the fled mist all meanness put away<br /></span>
<span>And the air clear and keen as salt sea-spray....<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span>And yet no dream; no dream! I saw the whole,<br /></span>
<span>The reap'd fields, idle kine and wandering sheep.<br /></span>
<span>A weak wind through the near tall hedge-tree stole,<br /></span>
<span>And died where Dover's Hill rose bare and steep;<br /></span>
<span>I saw yet what I saw an hour ago,<br /></span>
<span>But knew what save by dreams I did not know&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>
<span><i>Sweet England!</i>&mdash;wild proud heart of things unspoken<br /></span>
<span>Spirit that men bear shyly and love purely;<br /></span>
<span>That dies to live anew a life unbroken<br /></span>
<span>As spring from every winter rising surely:<br /></span>
<span><i>Sweet England</i> unto generations sped,<br /></span>

<span>Yet from <i>her</i> eyes presage of victory<br /></span>

<span>It is not to be thought of (said her eyes)<br /></span>

<span>Should fall unheeded back through heavy air.<br /></span>
<span>But I have heard, in the night I have heard,<br /></span>
<span>When not a leaf in all the orchard stirred,<br /></span>

<span>No ill!<br /></span>
<span>Then all the silence was an echoing round,<br /></span>

<span>I found the light I sought.<br /></span>
<span>From somewhere south a bugle's note was flung,<br /></span>
<span>From somewhere north a sombre boom;<br /></span>
<span>On the opposing hills white flecks and grey<br /></span>

<span>Presently rose thick dust clouds from the green:<br /></span>
<span>Came up, or seemed to come, the instant beat<br /></span>
<span>Of marching feet;<br /></span>
<span>Then with the clouds the beating died away,<br /></span>
<span>And nothing was seen<br /></span>
<span>But broken hills and the new flush of day.<br /></span>

<span>All round the folding hills were like green waves,<br /></span>
<span>Tossing awhile together ere they fall<br /></span>
<span>And fling their salt on the steep stony beach.<br /></span>
<span>The sound I heard was sound of Roman feet&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>I saw the sparkling light on Roman glaives,<br /></span>
<span>I heard the Roman speech<br /></span>
<span>Answering the wild Iberian battle-call:<br /></span>
<span>They passed from sight on the long street.<br /></span>
<span>And I saw then the Mercian Kings that strode<br /></span>
<span>Proudly from the small city of grey stone<br /></span>
<span>And climbed the folding hills,<br /></span>
<span>Past the full springs that bubbled and flowed<br /></span>
<span>Through the soft valley and on to Avon stream.<br /></span>
<span>They passed&mdash;as all things pass and seem<br /></span>
<span>No other than a dream,<br /></span>
<span>All but the shining and the echo gone.<br /></span>
<span>But still I listened and looked. Their voice it was<br /></span>
<span>Blown through the valley grass;<br /></span>
<span>Their dust it was that sprang from the hard road<br /></span>
<span>Where now these English legions flowed,<br /></span>
<span>Waking the quiet like a steady wind.<br /></span>
<span>That ancient soldiery before me passed<br /></span>
<span>With all that followed them, and these the last<br /></span>
<span>Of my own generation, my own mind;<br /></span>
<span>Their strength and courage rooted deep in the earth<br /></span>
<span>That brings men to such splendid birth<br /></span>
<span>And no vain sacrifice ...<br /></span>
<span>It was as when the land all darkness lies,<br /></span>
<span>And shades, nor only shades, move freely out<br /></span>
<span>And through the trees are heard and all about<br /></span>
<span>Their ancient ways, 'neath the old stars and skies.<br /></span>
<span>So now in morning's light I knew them there<br /></span>
<span>Leading the men that marched and marched away,<br /></span>
<span>And mounted up the hill, and down the hill<br /></span>
<span>Passed from my eyes and ears, and left the air<br /></span>
<span>Trembling everywhere,<br /></span>
<span>And then how still!<br /></span>
&nbsp;</div><div class='stanza'>

<span><b>VI</b><br /></span>
</div><div class='stanza'>

<span>Then first I knew the joy that yet should be<br /></span>
<span>Ringing from camped hill and guarded sea<br /></span>
<span>With England's victory.<br /></span>
<span>The dust had stirred, the infinite dust had stirred,<br /></span>
<span>It was the courage of the past I heard,<br /></span>
<span>The virtue of those buried bones again<br /></span>
<span>Animate in these marching Englishmen;<br /></span>
<span>And nothing wanted if the dead but nerved<br /></span>
<span>The living hands that the same England served.<br /></span>
<span>With new-washed eyes I saw as I went down<br /></span>
<span>On the hill crest the oak-grove's crown,<br /></span>
<span>With new delighted ear heard the lark sing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>That mad delighted thing;<br /></span>
<span>The very smoke that rose was strangely blue,<br /></span>
<span>But most the orchard brightened wonderfully new,<br /></span>
<span>Where the wild spring, ere winter snow well gone,<br /></span>
<span>Scattered her whiter, briefer snow-cloud down.<br /></span>
<span>And England lovelier looked than when<br /></span>
<span>Her dead roused not her living men.<br /></span>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
